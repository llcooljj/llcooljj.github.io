Professionally, I like doing things at startups. Most recently, I've been in sales, though I have dabbled in product marketing, customer success, analytics, and corporate finance in the last 10 years. I'm realizing that I am incredibly values-driven, and I'm trying to be bolder about that.

Personally, I'm pretty simple in that I enjoy spending time with my family, reading, learning new things, and creating things (i.e. baking, cooking, writing music, knitting one winter).
