She shines in situations that involve creative problem solving and tight, cross-functional collaboration. She is energized by finding ways to maximize team happiness and productivity, holding her leadership, teammates, and direct reports to the highest standards for integrity and performance. She is fascinated by how tech companies scale sales execution, diversity and inclusion efforts, and company culture.

- Prior to joining the B2B tech world, JJ built and managed Warby Parker's Customer Experience Analytics and Strategy team under Warby's first employee, Mara Castro. In this role, she also supported the opening of and initial hiring plans for the company's 2nd corporate office in Nashville in 2014
