title: Feelings about COVID-19
---

It's been about a month since San Francisco's shelter-in-place decree, and I'm starting to be able to better articulate my feelings about the impact that COVID-19 has had on me.

Like always, Twitter has been both comforting and anxiety-inducing throughout this. It's interesting to reflect on how I use Twitter -- as a way to educate myself through others -- and how the accounts I collectively follow represent at once who I am and who I aspire to be; the network of people I want to know personally, but can only access through the osmosis of their carefully and sometimes not-so-carefully curated tweets. I see the hustle-porn signaling from overly optimistic founders and VCs, mixed in with the vulnerability champions who remind me that more people than I realize are just trying to get through each day without losing their shit. On my best days, I believe I have more in common with the former and, on my worst, with the latter.

Over the course of my time in tech, I've heard the term "emotional rollercoaster" more times than I can count, but usually applied to a time span of weeks, months, quarters. For example, working at a startup that's scrambling to find product market fit, or pivoting, or trying to outpace a competitor, or cycling through leadership. That kind of thrash is, in many ways, par for the course for masochists who choose to work at startups. But this is a different kind of emotional rollercoaster. This one seems to take place daily, even hourly, as I alternate between conflicting thoughts like:

*"Why didn't I study medicine so that I could be helping people?" and "I feel blessed and privileged for not having to be on the front lines right now."*

*"I'm sure there are people who need my company's technology right now, I just need to find them." and "What kind of piece of shit tries to peddle software when people are dying and the economy is on the verge of collapse?"*

*"I'm going to get so much done today." and "Why is it so hard to focus on anything at all?"*

I'm convinced this is just a symptom of the existential crisis that humanity is collectively faced with. We're all trying to control what we can given our current place in the world, but the feelings of guilt, anxiety, shame - these all stem from the nagging voice in our head that's really asking: what more can be done, and what can I do about it? What is my fundamental purpose in this life?
