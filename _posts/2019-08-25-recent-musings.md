It's been a while since I've made a practice of writing regularly. Being in sales these last two years has actually conditioned me to communicate mostly in snackable soundbytes, lest prospects lose their patience dealing with an overly verbose sales rep. Not that that's a legitimate excuse :-)

I've been meaning to summarize my experience in tech for a while, largely in hope of finding clarity and a cohesive narrative in a series of seemingly haphazard career moves. Over the past four years, I've been fortunate to see up close the many challenges that accompany company-building in San Francisco. Eventually I'd like to start my own business too, and I'd like to think the perspective I've gained will serve me well in doing so one day.

Let me see if I can just jot down a bunch of observations from my own experience first:

- Customer success managers aren't paid enough for what they do.
- Friction between sales and marketing functions usually comes from the fact that the teams are operating on different timeframes (i.e. when a sales rep asks "Do we have a one-pager on ______?" and a PMM delivers a nice piece of endlessly researched content 2 weeks later, it's already a month overdue)
- Defining company values early on - and not doing things that contradict those values - is absolutely necessary in creating a stable, motivating work environment for employees.
- Great ICs don't always make great people managers, even if they say they want to manage people. That's because people still think management is the only way to make upward progress in their careers.
- Hiring VPs who don't fit or add something positive to the existing company culture is almost always a mistake in the long run.
- Since most startups tend to favor internal referrals during the hiring process, chances are that a large percentage of the company will be made up of people from the same or similar networks or socio-economic backgrounds as the employees who referred them.

Will dive into these at a later date!
