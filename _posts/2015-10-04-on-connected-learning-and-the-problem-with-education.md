title: On Connected Learning and the Problem with Education
---

When I was in high school, I struggled with math - considerably. I hated it all; algebra, geometry, calculus. To my parents, who emigrated to the United States in 1980 and got their degrees from Wentworth Institute of Technology, this was baffling. Math, like love, was a universal language. How could it not come naturally? Just memorize the formulas, they said.

At Holy Cross, I failed an exam for the first and only time in my entire life. In Statistics. I couldn't wrap my head around these theoretical concepts: normal distribution, standard deviation, and t-tests; not to mention, I found the textbook examples boring, irrelevant and, sometimes, even more confusing than the lessons themselves. It would be  years before I finally saw the practical value of using statistics, when I became an Analyst at [Warby Parker](https://www.warbyparker.com/), and someone like [Carl Anderson](https://twitter.com/leapingllamas) cared enough about me and my small team of junior analysts to lead biweekly, hour-long, Q&A sessions on when and how to apply statistics to our Customer Experience Analytics.

In an [interview](http://spotlight.macfound.org/featured-stories/entry/john-seely-brown-beyond-creativity-cultivate-imagination/#sthash.gwz9i4Us.dpuf) with journalist Heather Chaplin, John Seely Brown says,

  > It was the beginning of a long transformation in my mind about the shift from being an expert in content to being skilled at reading context."

Context, in his example, refers to  the broader circumstances that enrich one's understanding of content. The details that can transform meaning and, in my case, accelerate the transmission of knowledge. I would argue that it's an unequivocally powerful and necessary learning tool that is ineffectively delivered alongside content in today's classrooms.

Take this [example](http://college.cengage.com/mathematics/blackboard/content/larson/calc8e/calc8e_solution_main.html?CH=00&SECT=a&TYPE=se) from a newer version of my Calculus textbook in high school: 

  > Find the sales necessary to break even (R=C) if the cost C of producing *x* units is C = 5.5 âˆšx + 10,000 and the revenue for selling *x* units is R = 3.29x.

The word problem itself does an excellent job providing the information needed (R=C) and, as such, does not require you to understand context whatsoever to be able to solve the problem. How, then, are students, who have been conditioned to isolate and solve for content, ever expected to develop the skills necessary to solve for context?

The problem with our existing education model, Brown seems to imply, is that it institutionalizes that the right standard for measuring intelligence is one's ability to learn content primarily in a classroom setting. He suggests that we refocus that emphasis to one on connected learning instead.

  > [Connected learning](http://clalliance.org/why-connected-learning/) forg[es] links between students' academic studies, their personal passions, and opportunities to engage with peers who support and share their interests.

Enabled by the Digital Age, it's essentially a model that acknowledges how the technological advancements of the 21st Century have shaped the way students can and do learn today. Students are supplementing their education with free online resources offered by groups like [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/), or even Youtube tutorials. Coders can ask each other technical questions and solicit feedback on forums like [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/). Tapping into this wellspring of information is only limited by one's access to the Internet - (see how Facebook's working on that very important project [here](https://internet.org/])).

I'm interested in this idea of Connected Learning because I am interested in tackling how to disrupt education on an institutional level. I want to figure out how to successfully leverage the digitization and democratization of information, and I want classrooms and workplaces to accommodate and appreciate different learning processes and styles. Perhaps most importantly, I want education to be a universal right.

  > If you understand the potential of these exponential technologies to transform everything from energy to education, you have a different perspective on how we can solve the grand challenges of humanity. - Ray Kurzweil, [*On the exponential curve: inside Singularity University*](http://www.wired.co.uk/magazine/archive/2013/05/singularity-university/on-the-exponential-curve)
  
Solving the grand challenges of humanity? Sounds like we need a revolution, and fast.
